    "This tutorial contains an introduction to word embeddings. You will train your own word embeddings using a simple Keras model for a sentiment classification task, and then visualize them in the [Embedding Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing text as numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models take vectors (arrays of numbers) as input. When working with text, the first thing you must do is come up with a strategy to convert strings to numbers (or to \"vectorize\" the text) before feeding it to the model. In this section, you will look at three strategies for doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-hot encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first idea, you might \"one-hot\" encode each word in your vocabulary. Consider the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\". The vocabulary (or unique words) in this sentence is (cat, mat, on, sat, the). To represent each word, you will create a zero vector with length equal to the vocabulary, then place a one in the index that corresponds to the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a vector that contains the encoding of the sentence, you could then concatenate the one-hot vectors for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point: This approach is inefficient.** A one-hot encoded vector is sparse (meaning, most indices are zero). Imagine you have 10,000 words in the vocabulary. To one-hot encode each word, you would create a vector where 99.99% of the elements are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encode each word with a unique number\n",
    "\n",
    "A second approach you might try is to encode each word using a **unique number**. Continuing the example above, you could assign 1 to \"cat\", 2 to \"mat\", and so on. You could then encode the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\" as a dense vector like [5, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2]. This appoach is efficient. Instead of a sparse vector, you now have a dense one (where all elements are full).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two downsides to this approach, however:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The integer-encoding is arbitrary (it does not capture any relationship between words).\n",
    "\n",
    "* An integer-encoding can be challenging for a model to interpret. A linear classifier, for example, learns a single weight for each feature. Because there is no relationship between the similarity of any two words and the similarity of their encodings, this feature-weight combination is not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings give us a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding. Importantly, you do not have to specify this encoding by hand. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values (the length of the vector is a parameter you specify). Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are trainable parameters (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer). It is common to see word embeddings that are 8-dimensional (for small datasets), up to 1024-dimensions when working with large datasets. A higher dimensional embedding can capture fine-grained relationships between words, but takes more data to learn.\n"

A performance not to be missed, it won't leave you untouched.<br /><br />It's a pity that this film probably won't be watched by the general public in the US - it's probably too devoid of outright action to appeal to moviegoers. Still, I feel it's one of the best and most thought provoking war films I've seen.\"\n",

They are nothing but a bunch of scumbags who came from an even bigger scumbag John Gotti. John Gotti got what he deserved and should have gotten the gallows but at least he was taken off the streets and put in a cage like the wild animal he was. So to make this show is not about Victoria Gotti and her 3 punk kids but rather its a form of a celebration of John Gotti's life. I mean hey look at the nice home Victoria has. That all came from blood money on the hands of her scumbag of a father. Is she willing to give that up after knowing this? I don't think so because she is in a sense a gangster herself. The producers of this show should offer an apology.\"\n",
      "1 b'\"Tintin and I\" first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary. The photography and the editing are truly breath-taking (almost anti-Dogma).<br /><br />We follow the life of Tintin drawer Herg\\xc3\\xa9 through an open-hearted interview from 1971. The Tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century. In the midst of these Herg\\xc3\\xa9 has his own demons to fight with, and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection.<br /><br />Even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from Tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums, the story of Herg\\xc3\\xa9 is told entirely through interviews and archive material, and never through reconstructions.<br /><br />Herg\\xc3\\xa9 lived the turbulent life of a true, suffering artist. But the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.'\n",
      "0 b\"This is a pretty run of the mill family move that I am sure most children will enjoy but with really no that much to please any adults viewing the movie. The premise of the film is that Belushi's cop character takes his retirement but gets drawn into a case which results in him becoming a private investigator. The movie's plot is so obvious most of the kids will surely pick the ending before it happens. But additionally to that there seem to be story arcs and sub plots that are forgotten about as the movie progresses. This coupled with a sub plot where the titular K-9 gets pimped out by Belushi. One to be avoided I am afraid.\"\n",
      "1 b\"1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda): Weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think that was the relationship. A kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film. Don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film.<br /><br />\"\n"
